Since I was young, I was intrigued by automatisation in the software world.

I started learning software skills by the time I was 16.

Most of the skills I've learned came from learning it myself.

From designing the backend, database and application using tools like: 
- UML
- use cases
- ERD 
- BPMN

To creating a stable backend using the right technologies for its use case like: 
- Node.js + express/koa
- Asp.net
- Java Spring boot 
- PHP
- Gatsby

To finally creating a well-designed front-end application that is built with technologies like: 
- Next.js
- React.js
- template engines like Pug
- PHP

My favourite part of the whole stack is the backend because of its security needs, logical and object designs.

I'm currently working with PHP, JavaScript and MySQL

I try to stay in trend with the next best technologies and challenging myself to teach and use those technologies to widen my knowledge.
